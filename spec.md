# Chemist.ke Backend Specification

## 1. Architecture Overview
- Microservices architecture using Go
- gRPC for inter-service communication
- Echo web framework for HTTP API endpoints
- Redis for caching
- PostgreSQL for primary data storage
- MongoDB for CMS content storage

## 2. Microservices

### 2.1 User Service
- User registration and authentication
- Profile management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### 2.2 Product Service
- Product catalog management
- Inventory tracking
- Pricing and discounts

### 2.3 Order Service
- Order processing
- Payment integration
- Order status tracking

### 2.4 Telehealth Service
- Appointment scheduling
- Video consultation management
- Electronic health records (EHR) integration

### 2.5 CMS Service
- Article creation and management
- Content categorization
- Search functionality

### 2.6 Notification Service
- Email notifications
- SMS notifications
- Push notifications

## 3. Data Storage

### 3.1 PostgreSQL Databases
- Users
- Products
- Orders
- Appointments
- Inventory

### 3.2 MongoDB Database
- CMS content (articles, media)

## 4. Caching
- Implement Redis caching for:
  - Product catalog
  - User sessions
  - Frequently accessed content

## 5. API Gateway
- Implement an API Gateway using Echo to:
  - Route requests to appropriate microservices
  - Handle authentication and authorization
  - Implement rate limiting and request throttling

## 6. Security
- Implement JWT for authentication
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

## 7. Logging and Monitoring
- Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack)
- Set up application performance monitoring (APM)
- Implement health check endpoints for each service

## 8. Testing
- Unit tests for each service
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Load testing for performance optimization

## 9. Deployment
- Containerize each microservice using Docker
- Use Kubernetes for orchestration
- Implement CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitLab CI, Jenkins)

## 10. Scalability
- Design services to be horizontally scalable
- Implement database sharding for high-traffic services
- Use load balancers for distributing traffic

## 11. Compliance
- Ensure HIPAA compliance for handling medical data
- Implement data retention and deletion policies
- Set up audit trails for sensitive operations

## 12. Integration Points
- Payment gateways (e.g., M-Pesa, PayPal)
- Logistics providers for order fulfillment
- External EHR systems
- SMS and email service providers

## 13. CMS Functionality
- Markdown support for article writing
- Version control for content
- Scheduled publishing
- SEO optimization features

## 14. Performance Optimization
- Implement database query optimization
- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Optimize gRPC message sizes

## 15. Backup and Disaster Recovery
- Implement regular automated backups
- Design a disaster recovery plan
- Set up data replication for critical services
